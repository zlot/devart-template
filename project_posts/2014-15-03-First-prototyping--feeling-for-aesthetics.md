First prototyping, feeling for aesthetics
=========================================

So we got together and had a coding sesh.

Thanks to my sleep-deprived nature, I forgot to bring the projector and cables for the setup of our recursive scenario, so we tried to emulate the scenario in code. This was quite a nice, serendipitous exploration.

Computing the recursive view can be quite powerful since it's much easier to control than the physical environment and we can quickly ideate over many more possibilities.

Here are some snapshots of the effects we got (*it looks much cooler interacting with the actual program!*)

I stubled upon a really interesting visual phenomena this week which has been intriguing me with possibilities ever since.

It is especially relevant for this project as it ties in very well with our brainstorming for the concept underpinning the installation. In the last blog we discussed our moodboard and current interests, things such as glaciers, ice blink, the ganzfeld effect, whiteout phenomena, and the more disorientating light works of Olafur Eliasson.

You can find a video I made of it below. Stare at the man. As the image gets blurred out, the outline of the man can appear so solidly for a quarter of a second, before washing away into the aether of perception.

Sometimes it works. It must depend on a lot of factors, such as how long you have been staring, how fast the blur happens, the figure/ground contrast, and colours as well. I have tried blurring out other objects, and other people, but I couldn't get it to work as well as it did with this picture.

This is very much like the Jesus optical illusion you may or may not have come across before. If you haven't you're in for a great time!

So there's some experimenting to do. I believe the soft-coloured figure of the man has something to do with the effectiveness of this image, creating an interesting, lingering halo-effect when suddenly the figure is dispersed by a blur effect.

I have been experimenting with trying to find that threshold: blurring the figure at the correct speed for optimum visual phenomena, and what figure/ground colours work best.

We will post up some code of our experiments in the next post. This lingering ghost-like effect, combined with a recursive video-feed that is taking in visitors of the installation is our current focus. We have some exciting, large-scale concepts for the size and layout of the installation, which we will also share next blog post. 

As a teaser, let it be known that we are considering at least 8 projectors, some fog machines, and a lot of light :)
