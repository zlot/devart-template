# Final Post
## The Concept
In a room washed with white light, edges and corners chamfered out, fog machines create a space devoid of visual distance. This is a space that plays tricks on all senses. Traces of people, real and digital, flow through the area. A ganzfild effect is induced — was that me in the distance? Silhouettes seemingly appear through the haze, as  a recursive mirror reflection of the present. As travellers come and go, from digital observers to muddy footprints, the space remembers them all, adding us all to a record of time with logarithmic significance *.

## The Experience
Travellers enter a long, dark, narrowing corridor. After some time, the traveller turns a corner and finds themselves immersed within a bright space. It takes a while for human eyes to adjust. Soon enough, they realise they can’t see the boundaries of this seemingly infinite landscape. Not being able to find any edges and immersed in fog, they lose their sense of space, distance, and time. 

Silhouetted figures can be seen wandering around this featureless space, partially obscured and revealed in washes of digital noise — a ganzfield effect is induced on the viewer. Is that another person? Is that me? Is there anything there at all?

When the traveller finally departs the space, reentering the dark widening corridor, they continue to see figures, strangers, family, friends, the departed, perhaps their younger selves, moving at the periphery of their vision.

## The Technology
The room, in which the installation takes place, consists of eight small cameras embedded into its walls. We envision each camera will be connected / a part of a device (such as an iPod Touch) which can join an existing Google Hangout. A primary computer hosts the Hangout On Air Live, allowing people all over the world to experience the installation in realtime. The primary computer hacks the hangouts stream it receives from the eight cameras, reappropriating their use for the processing of video content and subverting the conventional intentions of a Google Hangout. The silhouettes of viewers, recorded by the cameras, are translated into the abyss of the walls. The video content is then sent to eight projectors which edge-blend their output around the chamfered room, creating a seamless immersive experience. 
 * Though planned as the next milestone, the current prototype does not yet store historic records of travellers.

## Discussion
Our project relies quite heavily on the space it is situated within. It will be quite interesting to see how the aesthetic can be transformed for a variety of different spaces – different sizes, environments, crowds, etc.

We intend to use Google Hangouts on Air which has a maximum duration of 8 hours. Currently, we will have to internally reinitialize the hangout manually every 8 hours and redirect the public-facing fixed url of the installation to that hangout every 8 hours. Ideally we would seek ways of bypassing or automating this process. It would also be quite intriguing to see what other ways we could hack Google Hangouts with a focus on communities and larger society.

## Reflection
We have had an absolute blast on devArt and it has been amazing seeing all the great work and processes posted! Looking forward to future devArt-type projects from everyone involved here!
