# Hello World!

Hi there! Weâ€™re two creative coders Mark and Hanley who are serendipitously exploring the artistic domain. We're strong admirers of process and are looking forward to our first collaboration as a duo.

A week ago we told each other we wanted to do this and have been independently processing since then.

A few days ago we had our first meetup, we jibed really well, discussing concepts such as ghosting, animals, mystical glaciers, altered perception, the loss of visual information, and the power of subtle interactions. Logistically, we wanted a concept that would be powerful in its basic form but widely extensible with time.

We came up with a draft statement to give ourselves some direction:
Example of Preliminary Concept / Artistic statement: A desolate environment filled with spirits where time stands infinite. Visual perception becomes deceiving, and a sense of self becomes lost to the void

Out of the available technologies out there, we've chosen to do our first prototypes in Processing (over say Unity or Openframeworks) as it will allow us to ideate more rapidly. Once we have fleshed out a solid direction, we will reevaluate the best platform for our project.
