## Description
In a room washed with white light, edges and corners chamfered out, fog machines create a space devoid of visual distance. This is a space that plays tricks on all senses. Traces of people, real and digital, flow through the area. A ganzfield effect is induced â€” was that me in the distance? Silhouettes seemingly appear through the haze, as  a recursive mirror reflection of the present. As travellers come and go, from digital observers to muddy footprints, the space remembers them all, adding us all to a record of time with logarithmic significance *.
