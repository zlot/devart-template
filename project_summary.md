## Description
In a room washed with white light, edges and corners chamfered out, fog machines create a space devoid of visual distance. This is a space that plays tricks on all senses. Traces of people, real and digital, flow through the area. A ganzfield effect is induced â€” was that me in the distance? Silhouettes seemingly appear through the haze, as  a recursive mirror reflection of the present. As travellers come and go, from digital observers to muddy footprints, the space remembers them all, adding us all to a record of time with logarithmic significance *.

### Instructions

1. Place the ScreenCapturer folder in your Processing libraries folder.
2. Run testSilhouettes.mov in a separate video player, and have it loop.testSilhouettes.mov is a quick processed mockup of what we imagine people's silhouettes will look like in the actual installation (whitewash of lights, fog). Perhaps people won't be so active as these people though!
3. Run the sketch. You will see a ScreenCapture window.
4. Place the ScreenCapture window over the looping testSilhouettes.mov
5. Hover your mouse over the x,y axis of the sketch. Go to all the extreme edges. This demonstrates the range of blur, ganzfield type effects we envision to program for the DevArt installation if we are offered a spot. Clicking will toggle a Hold of the blur effects; click anywhere to take your mouse x/y values again.
